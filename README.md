[MakeML](https://makeml.app?from=github_classification) is a Developer Tool for Creating Object Detection and Segmentation Neural Networks without a Line of Code. It's built to make the training process easy to setup. It is designed to handle data sets, training configurations, markup and training processes â€” all in one place.

## Image Classification Example with CoreML
Is an iOS project example that can be used to run your own CoreML Classification Model.

For using this project with another .mlmodel file, add it to the project and change this line with your name of the model.
```
guard let model = try? VNCoreMLModel(for: Model().model) else {
   return
}
```
